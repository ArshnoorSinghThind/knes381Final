In March 2001, during the India vs Australia Test match on the iconic Eden Gardens pitch, Harbhajan Singh delivered one of the greatest spin bowling performances in cricket history. Claiming 15 wickets in the match, including a hat-trick which was the first ever by an Indian in Test cricket. His spell single-handedly turned series around and ended Australia's record-breaking 16-match winning streak. 

In this section we'll highlight how Harbhajan's flight variations, sharp dips, high bounce, and unpredictable turns decieved even world-class batters like Ponting and Gilchrist. 

Using video analysis, we will unpack the secretes of Harbhajan's off-spin bowling and how subtle changes in finger position, release point, and bounce height played a key role.
