On September 19, 2007, during the inaugural ICC Cricket T20 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh etched his name into cricket history by smashing six consecutive sixes in an over off of England's Stuart Broad. His 12 ball half-century remains the fastest in international T20s to this day! 

In this section, we breakdown what made Singh's performance unstoppable that day. From explosive swings to incredible footwork, every six he hit that day was a textbook example. 

Using video analysis, we'll explore how core strength, head and body alignment, and precise timing allowed Singh to effortlessly generate power.
