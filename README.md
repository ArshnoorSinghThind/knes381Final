# KNES 381 Final Project

## Overview
This project showcases the integration of a Python program, website development, and sport movement analysis to create a comprehensive resource for understanding the science behind cricket. The project includes data processing, chart generation, video analysis, and educational content that serves as an informative and engaging platform for users interested in the biomechanics of cricket.

## Features
Python Program: A data processing tool that uses kinesiology-related data to generate graphical representations. 

Website: The website is built using Jekyll and Markdown.

Graphic Development: The project includes a variety of charts and illustrations that represent data from the Python program.

Video Analysis: The project features a video analysis that demonstrates the biomechanics of key cricket movements. The videos showcases specific skills, such as bowling techniques, with clear explanations and annotations.

## Usage
The Tools Page contains the Python data analysis tool and interactive charts.

The Game Page showcases an interactive maze game made using scratch.

The About Me Page provides a brief introduction about me, and the motivation behind this project.

## Concluding Statements 
Overall, I enjoyed my time in KNES 381 with Dr. Holash, who was an excellent professor! Dr. Holashâ€™s approach to teaching allowed me to deeply engage with the material, and his real-time 
feedback on my projects was incredibly important in helping me improve my understanding of key concepts. The hands-on experience I gained from this class was incredibly unique and valuable!
