# Hello!

Hey! I'm Arshnoor Singh Thind, a third-year Kinesiology student at the University of Calgary with a passion for human movement, sport, and everything in between. When I’m not deep in course-work, you’ll probably find me out on the pitch—cricket is more than a sport to me, it's a way of life.

Whether it's studying biomechanics or smashing sixes, I bring focus, drive, and discipline to everything I do. I'm also deeply inspired by Sikh history and Gurbani, grounding myself in faith and resilience through life’s innings.

"Cricket is not just a game, it's a war of patience, skill, and heart."

"ਦੇਹ ਸਿਵਾ ਬਰੁ ਮੋਹਿ ਇਹੈ ਸੁਭ ਕਰਮਨ ਤੇ ਕਬਹੂੰ ਨ ਟਰੋਂ ॥" 
"Deh siva bar mohe eh-hey subh karman te kabhu na taro ॥" – O Lord, grant me this boon, May I never deviate from good deeds ॥
